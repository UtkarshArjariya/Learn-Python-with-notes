name = "John"
age = 45
city = "New York"

print("My name is " + name + ", I'm " + str(age) + " years old, I live in " + city) # method 1

print("My name is",name, ", I'm", age, "years old, I live in", city)                # method 2

#formatted string

print(f"My name is {name}, I'm {age} years old, I lives in {city}")

# Inline printing with the help of print() command
# Compiler automatically add some end parameters in the print command ex. print("Hello", end="\n", sep=" ")

print("Hello","Coders", end=" ", sep="--")
print("World")

#There are two types of conversion i) Explicit conversion ii) Implicit conversion
#Explicit conversion: done by the user
#Implicit conversion: done by the compiler

a = int(input("Enter the value for a: "))
b = int(input("Enter the value for b: "))
print("The sum of a and b is", a+b)
print(type(a), type(b))
